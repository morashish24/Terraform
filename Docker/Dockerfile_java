# Step 1: Use an official OpenJDK base image (lightweight version)
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim AS builder

# Step 2: Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the source code and build files into the container
COPY . /app

# Step 4: Build the Java application (if using Maven/Gradle)
RUN ./mvnw package -DskipTests

# Step 5: Use a minimal runtime image for the final application
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Step 6: Set the working directory for the runtime container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 7: Copy only the built JAR from the builder stage
COPY --from=builder /app/target/myapp.jar /app/myapp.jar

# Step 8: Set environment variables (optional)
ENV JAVA_OPTS="-Xms256m -Xmx512m"

# Step 9: Expose the application port
EXPOSE 8080

# Step 10: Define the command to run the application
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "myapp.jar"]
